phalcon-vg-console-database
===========================

Just an example Phalcon app that is a front end for a relational Videogame console database

Intended as a proof of concept in learning the Phalcon full stack framework, not really intended as a spectacular 
open ended database.

Uses:
+Phalcon 1.5
+MySQL
+Bootstrap 3

Currently Implemented
+Basic entry, editing and retrieval of console and company data

Future goals

+Admin user management for editing/adding records

+Graphs and charts for comparing console stats
+Image upload and display
+Table sorting with DataTables components
+Country flags for companies
+More granular tech specs on consoles
+Maybe a master list of games, though that will take a community effort
+Actual bona fide security
+A layout that doesn't look like Apple puked on my screen
